#Ruby Quiz
##Makers Academy Week 9 Test


###Aim

The aim of this test was to revisit the basics of Ruby. There were 41 failing specs, and we had to make them all pass.

There were also two further challenges:

* writing FizzBuzz without using the modulo method, and
* generating the lyrics of '99 bottles of beer on the wall'

The aim was to also keep the code clean, answering nearly all in no more than a couple of lines of code.


###Other details

The task was set by Alex Peattie, [@alexpeattie](http://www.github.com/alexpeattie)


###To do

* Refactor some of my methods based on Alex's feedback
